## Hagemu is a GameBoy emulator

This is an attempt to write a GameBoy emulator in C99. This is a personal project to learn more about computers and emulation. Raylib is used to write the pixels and handle input. The end goal is to compile this project into WebAssembly using Emscripten. At the moment, this project is still a work in progress.

### Playable games (perhaps minor glitches)
- Tetris
- Dr. Mario
- Super Mario Land
- Metroid
- Zelda: Link's Awakening
